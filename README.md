### CareTrust REIT, Inc (CTRE)    
#### Income Statement  
â€¢	Over the past five years, CareTrust REIT, Inc. has exhibited stability and consistent growth in profitability.

The impact of these acquisitions/investments is evident in the Cash Flow Statement.  
#### Balance Sheet  
â€¢ Looking at the Liabilities to Asset Ratio over the last 5 years, it can be observed that approximately half of CareTrust REIT, Inc's liabilities are being used to finance their assets, while the remaining portion comes from equity or shareholders.  
â€¢ As mentioned earlier, when considering the Liabilities to Equity Ratio, CareTrust REIT, Inc demonstrates a higher reliance on equity for funding their business and operations.  
#### Cash Flow  
â€¢	 Over the past 5 years, CareTrust REIT has acquired a variety of properties to expand their housing options for seniors and nursing facilities. This expansion strategy may help explain the occasional negative cash flow experienced in certain years. Additionally, expenses such as dividends and debt repayment could also contribute to this situation.  

### Home Depot Inc (HD)  
#### Income Statement  
â€¢	Over the past 5 years, Home Depot has maintained a stable condition and has consistently shown steady gains.  
#### Balance Sheet  
â€¢ When examining the Liabilities to Asset Ratio over the last 5 years, Home Depot has been close to or exceeding its liabilities compared to its assets. This could indicate that the company is experiencing distress and/or may face difficulties in repaying its debts. However, it is highly unlikely that Home Depot will go bankrupt despite having higher liabilities than assets.  
â€¢ Looking at the Liabilities to Equity ratio over the last 5 years, Home Depot has had excessive liabilities in comparison to its Shareholderâ€™s Equity. Furthermore, there were years with a negative ratio, indicating that liabilities exceeded assets.  
#### Cash Flow  
â€¢ Analyzing the Net Cash from Acquisitions & Divestitures in 2020, it appears that Home Depot made a significant acquisition in December of that year. They acquired HD Supply, which explains the relatively large difference in total cash from Investing Activities compared to the years 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2021.  
â€¢ Considering the Net Change in Cash or the amount of leftover Cash, Home Depot has experienced fluctuations over the years, either gaining or losing. It is expected that they may recover in the next year to three years.

#### Income Statement  
â€¢	Over the past 5 years, Lowe's has appeared to be in a stable condition and has experienced consistent growth. However, in 2018, Lowe's did generate slightly lower earnings compared to the previous year in 2017, but it managed to recover in the subsequent years.  
#### Balance Sheet  
â€¢ Analyzing the Liabilities to Asset Ratio over the last 5 years, Lowe's has utilized a significant portion of their debt/liabilities to cover the cost of their assets, ranging from approximately 80% to 110%. In the year 2021, their liabilities exceeded their assets. While this may raise concerns, it doesn't necessarily indicate a negative outcome. It is possible that due to the nature of their industry, Lowe's requires additional debt to fund their assets and sustain their business operations.  
â€¢ Observing the Liabilities to Equity Ratio over the past 5 years, Lowe's has experienced a gradual increase in this ratio. For instance, in 2017, for every $1 in Shareholder's Equity, the company owed $5.01. This figure rose to $8.47 in 2018, $19.02 in 2019, and $31.52 in 2020. As of 2021, the ratio turned negative due to liabilities surpassing assets.  
#### Cash Flow  
â€¢ In 2017, Lowe's engaged in investment activities by acquiring Maintenance Supply Headquarters for approximately $509M-$512M. However, there were no further acquisitions or divestitures in the subsequent years (2018-2021). Aside from that, Lowe's appears to have maintained a steady flow of other investment activities.

â€¢ The Liabilities to Equity ratio is also stable. However, their liabilities are almost equivalent to their debt, but not excessively so. They rely on debt for a little over 50% of their funding.   
#### Cash Flow  
â€¢ NVR, Inc. has shown an increased amount of cash flow over the past 5 years, except for 2021. This could be due to factors such as repurchasing its own equity or repurchasing NVR, Inc. shares of stock.
